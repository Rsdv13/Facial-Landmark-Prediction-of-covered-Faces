# Facial-Landmark-Prediction-of-covered-Faces
Classified masked and un-masked face into trained and tested models. Used media pipe to synthesize a masked dataset from un-masked face dataset. 
Detected faces while testing data using Single Shot face detector and classified them using Neural networks. 
Using the classifier, classified the detected faces under the mask with highest accuracy considering higher epochs.
